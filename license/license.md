Open APIs
=========

The following APIs have been implemented

####open FDA - [Food Enforcement Reports] (https://open.fda.gov/food/enforcement/)
This is the api for all food product recalls monitored by the FDA. When an FDA-regulated product is either defective or potentially harmful, recalling that product—removing it from the market or correcting the problem—is the most effective means for protecting the public.

Recalls are almost always voluntary, meaning a company discovers a problem and recalls a product on its own. Other times a company recalls a product after FDA raises concerns. Only in rare cases will FDA request or order a recall. But in every case, FDA's role is to oversee a company's strategy, classify the recalled products according to the level of hazard involved, and assess the adequacy of the recall. Recall information is posted in the Enforcement Reports once the products are classified.


####Information Machine - [iam api] (http://iamdata.co/#api)
This is the APIs that capture product level purchase data from online or loyalty card transactions.  The servic provider collects item level purchase data from the largest merchants in the world. The APIs expose this purchase level data with details about the indvidual product information.
