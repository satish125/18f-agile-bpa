##Site Usage Instructions and Demo Account Information

###Site Usage – Your purchase data

As a new user to the site, we welcome you to review recent recalls listed on the homepage before signing up. Upon sign up, you will be directed to the Connect Stores page where you can connect your loyalty card accounts by entering the username and password and clicking Connect for each store*. Once you have connected your stores, the system will cross-reference your purchases with possible matches to recalls from the openFDA API. You can click through the potential matches to determine if your purchase was indeed recalled^.

### Site Usage - Demo User purchase data

For those who want to see a demonstration of the application without having to connect their personal store cards, we have created a demo account that is preloaded with connected store accounts with purchases that will return possible recall matches. We ask that you please keep all of the stores connected in this account. Login with the below credentials and you will be directed to the My Recalls page, which will take the purchases from the pre-loaded store accounts and look for matches on product recalls from the openFDA API.  The results will display potential matches of purchases to recalls for the last 365 days. 

We hope you enjoy using RecallRodent!

<i>*We do not store your store loyalty card login information in our system. They are stored in <a target="_blank" href="http://iamdata.co">Information Machine</a> – a site that passively collects and streams loyalty card purchases. Please follow these links to know more about their <a target="_blank" href="http://iamdata.co/security">security</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://iamdata.co/privacy">privacy</a> information. We access your purchase information through Information Machine’s APIs.</i>

<i>^The openFDA API only allows for 240 hits per minute, so if multiple users are testing at the same time, you may get a message stating that not all of the recalls have been checked.   We have discussed a number of methods for addressing this and were we to continue with a production product we are confident this issue can be resolved.</i>
