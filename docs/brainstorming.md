# Sprint 0: Product Idea Brainstorming

## Goals of Product Idea
* Does more than query and display FDA data!
* Remixes the data by:
** Collecting additional related data AND/OR
** Combining with a related consumer api
* Is meaningful and useful to a broad consumer audience
* Fills an unmet user need. (There is not already an existing product that accomplishes the same thing.)

## Initial concepts

Two product types emerged
1. A product that collects my purchases and prescriptions, and alerts me to recalls or adverse events.
2. A mobile app notifies me of adverse events or recalls based on my current location, and allows me to file a report tied to my current location. This would crowdsource adverse events and visualize things like salmonella outbreaks in real time.

## Refining

In discussing and refining idea #1, we knew we didn't want to force users to manually enter purchases.  That could be extensive and tedious for users and a major barrier to entry. We searched for apis to import purchases, so users would not have to manually enter them. We considered MyFitnessPal, BigOven, Walgreens, and others, before we discovered [Information Machine](http://iamdata.co).


## Epics

After discovering [Information Machine](http://iamdata.co), we settled on the product concept and created epics.
